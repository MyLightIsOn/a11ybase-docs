title: Keyboard Interaction Question 1
description: Is there a skip-to-main-content link provided?
---

## Description

A skip-to-main-content link allows keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation and jump directly to the main content of the page.

## Why This Matters?

Without a skip-to-main-content link, keyboard users may need to tab through every navigation item before accessing the main content. This can be frustrating and time-consuming for those relying solely on keyboard navigation.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine you're navigating a website with only a keyboard, and every time you visit a new page, you're forced to tab through a lengthy navigation menu to get to the content you want. This experience quickly becomes exhausting for users with mobility issues or those relying on keyboard navigation. A skip-to-main-content link allows users to efficiently reach the main content without unnecessary steps.

## Developer Considerations

Developers need to ensure that the skip-to-main-content link is included and works as expected. This means the link should be the first focusable element when the user presses "Tab" and should visibly appear when focused. The link should lead to the main content using a unique `id` for the main section. Additionally, ensure the link is visually hidden but becomes visible when it receives focus, making it usable but not intrusive for all users.

## Example:

```html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>

<main id="main-content">
  <!-- Main content of the page goes here -->
</main>

<style>
  .skip-link {
    position: absolute;
    top: -40px; /* Skip link is positioned off screen */
    left: 0;
    background: #000;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 8px;
    z-index: 100;
    text-decoration: none;
  }

  .skip-link:focus {
    top: 0; /* Skip link is positioned on screen when in focus */
  }
</style>
```
