## Overview

Keyboard accessibility is a fundamental aspect of developing inclusive user interfaces. Many users rely on keyboard navigation to interact with digital products, including those with physical or mobility impairments, vision impairments, or those who prefer keyboard shortcuts for efficiency. This guide will help developers create intuitive, accessible interfaces that are fully navigable via keyboard.

### Developer's Role

Developers play a key role in ensuring that all interactive elements, such as buttons, links, and form fields, are keyboard operable. This includes managing focus states, ensuring proper tab order, and avoiding keyboard traps. Developers should also implement visible focus indicators and ensure that modals and popups behave correctly with focus management.

By using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary, developers can guarantee that the keyboard navigation experience is predictable, intuitive, and accessible to all users.

## Questions for Keyboard Interaction Heuristics

The following heuristics form the foundation of keyboard accessibility in A11yBase. Each heuristic is accompanied by a series of questions to guide your development decisions:

- **<a href="/docs/developer-guide/keyboard-interaction/question-1">Question 1:</a>** Is there a skip-to-main-content link provided?
- **<a href="/docs/developer-guide/keyboard-interaction/question-2">Question 2:</a>** Are we avoiding keyboard traps?
- **<a href="/docs/developer-guide/keyboard-interaction/question-3">Question 3:</a>**  Is tabbing order predictable, logical, and intuitive?
- **<a href="/docs/developer-guide/keyboard-interaction/question-4">Question 4:</a>** Is the focus indicator clearly visible when active elements receive focus?
- **<a href="/docs/developer-guide/keyboard-interaction/question-5">Question 5:</a>** Are buttons, links, and other CTAs designed to consider both hover and focus states?
- **<a href="/docs/developer-guide/keyboard-interaction/question-6">Question 6:</a>** Are all buttons, links, and interactive components fully operable using only a keyboard?
- **<a href="/docs/developer-guide/keyboard-interaction/question-7">Question 7:</a>** Does focus automatically shift to newly opened modals or popups, and return to the previous element when they are closed?
- **<a href="/docs/developer-guide/keyboard-interaction/question-8">Question 8:</a>** Are adjacent links, such as images and text links, that point to the same location combined into a single CTA?
- **<a href="/docs/developer-guide/keyboard-interaction/question-9">Question 9:</a>** Can single-character shortcuts be turned off or remapped, or are they only triggered when the relevant control has focus?
