A11yBase is a design system and educational tool created for designers and developers who seek to improve their understanding and application of accessibility in digital products. It serves as both a practical resource and a learning guide, equipping product teams with the foundational knowledge and tools to build more inclusive user interfaces.


## Why I Created A11yBase

The motivation behind building A11yBase is twofold:

- **To deepen personal knowledge of design systems:** The process of creating A11yBase is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in developing a design system from the ground up.

- **To foster inclusive design and development:** A11yBase serves as a resource for others to learn about accessibility. It aims to simplify the learning curve for designers and developers who may feel overwhelmed by the perceived complexity of accessibility.

As an accessibility program manager at two enterprise SaaS companies, I’ve observed that accessibility is often perceived as a niche, complex field, understood by only a few. This misconception leads many teams to deprioritize or avoid investing the necessary time and effort in making their products accessible. A11yBase seeks to change that narrative.

## Mission of A11yBase

The mission of A11yBase is to make accessibility approachable and incremental. By breaking down accessibility into manageable pieces, teams can gradually integrate best practices without feeling overwhelmed. This approach allows product teams to adopt accessibility principles at their own pace, fostering a sustainable, long-term commitment to inclusivity.

A11yBase is built around core accessibility heuristics, making it a tool that not only provides reusable components but also teaches teams why and how to make their products accessible. By embedding accessibility into the design process, A11yBase reduces barriers to adoption and empowers teams to create inclusive experiences for all users.

## Who is A11yBase For?

A11yBase is designed for:
- **Designers:** Those who want to create accessible, experiences and dive deeper into inclusive design.

- **Developers:** Teams looking for accessible, reusable components with best practices built-in.

## Design Principals Overview

Design Principles Overview

A11yBase is grounded in key design principles, which are drawn from [core accessibility heuristics](#). These principles guide the creation and use of accessible components:

- **Accessibility First:** All components are built to meet or exceed WCAG standards and are .

- **Incremental Learning:** Accessibility can be adopted gradually, making the learning process more sustainable.

- **Flexibility for Branding:** A11yBase provides the accessible foundation, while product teams can layer their own brand identity on top.

- **Educational by Design:** Every component and pattern includes accessible best practices, helping teams understand not just what to do but why it’s important.
