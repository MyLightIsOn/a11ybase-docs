## Introduction to Accessible Design

Accessible design ensures that digital products can be used by everyone, including individuals with disabilities. For designers, accessibility is about creating inclusive experiences that consider all users from the very beginning of the design process. This guide will help you understand how to apply accessibility principles to your designs, focusing on the core heuristics in A11yBase. By following these guidelines, you can design products that are not only compliant with accessibility standards but also provide better user experiences for everyone.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with a Heuristic**: Identify which core heuristic applies to your current design task (e.g., Keyboard Interaction).
2. **Review Heuristic Questions**: Visit the overview page for that heuristic and review the guiding questions to evaluate your design.
3. **Identify Gaps**: If you notice missing elements, like the absence of a skip-to-main-content link, click through to the specific Designer Guide section.
4. **Learn Best Practices**: In the Designer Guide section, read about best practices, guidelines, and see examples for applying this heuristic in your design.
5. **Collaborate and Implement**: Share insights with your development team to ensure accessible designs are implemented correctly.
6. **Test Your Design**: After applying changes, use accessibility testing tools to validate the accessibility of your design.
