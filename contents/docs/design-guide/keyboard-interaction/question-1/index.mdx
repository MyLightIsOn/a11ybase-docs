title: Keyboard Interaction Question 1
description: Is there a skip-to-main-content link provided?
---

## Description

A skip-to-main-content link allows users to bypass repetitive navigation elements and quickly access the main content of the page.

## Why This Matters?

Without a skip link, keyboard users must repeatedly tab through navigation menus before reaching the main content, making the experience tedious and inefficient.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a keyboard to navigate a webpage with a long navigation menu. Each time you visit a new page, you have to tab through the same set of navigation links to reach the main content. For someone with mobility impairments or using assistive technology, this repetitive interaction can be exhausting and time-consuming. A skip-to-main-content link empowers users to efficiently access the primary content without frustration, improving their overall experience.

## Design Considerations

Designers should ensure that the skip-to-main-content link is visually accessible at the top of the page and becomes visible when focused. The link should be clearly labeled (e.g., "Skip to main content") and styled in a way that fits with the overall design but still stands out enough to be noticed. Consider its placement, so it appears as the first focusable element in the tab order. When clicked, it should seamlessly skip past repetitive content (such as navigation) and land directly on the primary content.

Keep in mind that skip links are not visible until they are in focus. Also, there are occasions where it is acceptable to have more than one skip link, however it is not recommended.
