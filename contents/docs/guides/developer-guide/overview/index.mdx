## Introduction to Accessible Development

Accessibility is a critical consideration for developers, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can interact with your product. This guide will help developers implement the core accessibility heuristics from A11yBase into their code. It focuses on practical development techniques to create accessible components, ensuring that products are compliant with standards and provide a better experience for all users.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with a Heuristic**: Identify which core heuristic relates to your current task (e.g., Keyboard Interaction).
2. **Review Heuristic Questions**: Visit the overview page for that heuristic and examine the specific questions to evaluate your implementation.
3. **Identify Gaps**: If you find an issue, such as missing skip links, click through to the relevant Developer Guide section.
4. **Implement Best Practices**: Follow the guideâ€™s code snippets and recommendations to ensure accessible implementation in your development.
5. **Test Your Code**: After making changes, test for accessibility using tools such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and browser accessibility tools.
