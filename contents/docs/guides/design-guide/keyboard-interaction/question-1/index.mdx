title: Question 1
description: Are adjacent links, such as images and text links, that point to the same location combined into a single Call To Action (CTA)?

## Description

This question ensures that all interactive elements are accessible and operable using the keyboard without unnecessary TAB stops or inefficient navigation.

## Design Considerations

As a designer, your role is to ensure that multiple links leading to the same destination (e.g., an image and a text link for an article) are combined into a single, intuitive clickable area. This reduces unnecessary TAB stops, improving the flow for keyboard navigation.

## Why This Matters?

When multiple focusable elements point to the same location, it creates unnecessary navigation stops for users who rely on keyboards. This can slow down their experience, cause frustration, and make the interface harder to use. By consolidating these elements into a single focusable area, you streamline navigation, reduce cognitive load, and provide a more intuitive experience.

**Empathy Focus:** Imagine a keyboard user having to press TAB multiple times just to reach the same content (once for the image and once for the headline). This adds unnecessary steps to the process.

## Best Practices for Designers

- **Combine Clickable Areas:**

    Ensure that both the image and text that point to the same destination are part of a single interactive element. Make sure the clickable area is large enough to encompass both elements without any confusion.

- **Focus States:**

	Ensure that when the element is focused, the entire clickable area (image + text) visibly changes, showing a clear focus state. This can be done with a border or background color change.

- **Hierarchy and Clarity:**

	Make the design clear by visually indicating that the image and text are part of a unified action (for example, wrapping both in a consistent border or using hover/focus states that show the two elements are linked).


## Examples:

- **Example 1:** An article preview with an image link and a text link both leading to the full article. Instead of having separate focusable elements, combine them into one.

<div className={"flex flex-col items-center"}>
	<figure style={{width: "350px"}}>
		<img src="/images/keyboard-interaction/question-1A.png" alt={"Article card wireframe with 3 links; the article itself, the title, and the Read More link. These are excessive TAB key presses."} />
		<figcaption><span style={{fontSize: "20px"}}>❌</span> Article card wireframe with 3 links; the article itself, the title, and the Read More link. These are excessive TAB key presses.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure style={{width: "350px"}}>
		<img src="/images/keyboard-interaction/question-1B.png" alt={"Article card wireframe with 1 link; the article itself. Also the text is now underlined. This minimizes TAB key presses."}/>
		<figcaption><span style={{fontSize: "20px"}}>✅</span> Article card wireframe with 1 link; the article itself. Also the text is now underlined. This minimizes TAB key presses.</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>


- **Example 2** Example: In a navigation menu with multiple adjacent buttons that lead to the same page (e.g., a settings icon and a text link next to each other), consolidate them into one clear, focusable CTA.

<div className={"flex flex-col items-center"}>
	<figure style={{width: "350px"}}>
		<img src="/images/keyboard-interaction/question-1C.png" alt={"Navigation links with focusble icons and text. These are excessive TAB key presses."} />
		<figcaption><span style={{fontSize: "20px"}}>❌</span> Navigation links with focusble icons and text. These are excessive TAB key presses.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure style={{width: "350px"}}>
		<img src="/images/keyboard-interaction/question-1D.png" alt={"Navigation links with icons and text consolidated into one focusable element. This minimizes TAB key presses."}/>
		<figcaption><span style={{fontSize: "20px"}}>✅</span> Navigation links with icons and text consolidated into one focusable element. This minimizes TAB key presses.</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

## Design Handoff

When passing your design to developers, include clear instructions that the image and text links should be combined into a single clickable area, and ensure that focus states are visually obvious.

## Summary

Designing for keyboard accessibility means making navigation intuitive and efficient. By combining adjacent links (such as an image and text) into a single focusable element, you reduce redundancy and improve the user experience for keyboard users. Always test your designs for focus order and visual cues to ensure clarity.
