## Overview

Keyboard accessibility is a fundamental aspect of designing inclusive user interfaces. Many users rely on keyboard navigation to interact with digital products, including those with physical or mobility impairments, vision impairments, or those who prefer keyboard shortcuts for efficiency. This guide will help designers create intuitive, accessible interfaces that are fully navigable via keyboard.

## Why Keyboard Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusivity:** Ensures that your product is usable by people with varying abilities, from individuals with mobility impairments to power users who prefer the keyboard.

- **Compliance:** Meeting keyboard accessibility requirements is a core part of the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), which many organizations must comply with to meet legal standards.

- **Improved UX:** Even users without accessibility needs benefit from streamlined keyboard navigation. Keyboard-friendly design often results in more efficient, intuitive interfaces.

## The Designer’s Role

As a designer, you play a crucial role in shaping the accessibility of your product. While developers implement keyboard interactions, it’s up to the design team to ensure that the interface is intuitive and doesn’t overload users with unnecessary navigation stops or interactions.

The Keyboard Interaction Heuristics presented in this guide will help you:

- Ask the right questions about how keyboard users interact with your designs.

- Design with focus states and navigable content in mind.

- Collaborate with developers to implement efficient and accessible keyboard interactions.


## How To Use This Guide

Each section in this guide corresponds to a key Keyboard Interaction Heuristic from the A11yBase design system. For each heuristic, you will find:

- Questions to ask yourself during the design process.
- Design tips and best practices for applying keyboard accessibility in your layouts.
- Examples of common patterns where keyboard interaction can be improved.

By following this guide, you will ensure that your designs not only meet accessibility standards but also provide a smooth, efficient experience for keyboard users.

## Questions for Keyboard Interaction Heuristics

The following heuristics form the foundation of keyboard accessibility in A11yBase. Each heuristic is accompanied by a series of questions to guide your design decisions:

    Question 1: Are adjacent links, such as images and text links, that point to the same location combined into a single CTA?


- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-1">Question 1:</a>** Are adjacent links, such as images and text links, that point to the same location combined into a single CTA?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-2">Question 2:</a>** Are all calls to action (CTAs) built to fully function with keyboard and touch in addition to the mouse?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-3">Question 3:</a>** Are we avoiding keyboard traps?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-4">Question 4:</a>** Can single-character shortcuts be turned off or remapped, or are they only triggered when the relevant control has focus??
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-5">Question 5:</a>** Can users cancel an operation by moving focus away from a control before releasing it?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-6">Question 6:</a>** Is tabbing order predictable, logical, and intuitive?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-7">Question 7:</a>** Are buttons, links, and other CTAs designed to consider both hover and focus states?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-8">Question 8:</a>** Is the focus indicator clearly visible when active elements receive focus?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-9">Question 9:</a>** Is there a skip-to-main-content link provided?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-10">Question 10:</a>** Are users able to dismiss newly displayed content without moving their mouse or shifting focus?
