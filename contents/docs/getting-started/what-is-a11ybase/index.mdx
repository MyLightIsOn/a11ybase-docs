**A11yBase** is an accessibility-first design system built to help product teams ensure accessibility is a core consideration in their products from the start. Designed as an educational tool, it provides a set of guidelines, best practices, and heuristics that teams can follow when building interfaces and components. Whether you're creating a new design system or refining an existing one, A11yBase serves as a comprehensive resource to enhance accessibility.

This system is based on six core accessibility heuristics, which help teams assess and improve the accessibility of their products. It empowers teams to prioritize inclusivity, ensuring that all users, regardless of their abilities, have a seamless and equitable experience.

A11yBase is more than a checklistâ€”it's a foundational guide for making thoughtful, accessible design decisions.
