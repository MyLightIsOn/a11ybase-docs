**A11yBase** is designed to guide product teams in improving accessibility step-by-step. Start by familiarizing yourself with the six core accessibility heuristics. Each heuristic focuses on a specific aspect of accessibility, such as keyboard interaction or screen reader support.

Use the **heuristic questions** provided under each core heuristic to evaluate your components and interfaces. These questions help you identify gaps in accessibility and ensure that your designs meet the needs of all users.

For **designers** and **developers**, apply these heuristics during the design and development phases to create accessible layouts, components, and interactions. **Product managers** can use A11yBase to track progress and ensure that accessibility is considered at every step.

Remember, A11yBase is a learning tool meant to guide your team toward more inclusive design. Itâ€™s not a substitute for formal standards but a way to help teams gradually improve accessibility practices.
