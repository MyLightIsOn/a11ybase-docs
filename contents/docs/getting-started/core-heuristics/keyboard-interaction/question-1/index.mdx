description: Are adjacent links pointing to unique locations combined into a single CTA?

## Description

This heuristic ensures that adjacent links, which point to unique but related destinations, are combined into a single Call to Action (CTA). This improves the usability of the interface by reducing redundancy and optimizing keyboard navigation.

## Requirement for Success

- Minimize TAB stops: Combining adjacent links reduces the number of focusable elements on the page, making keyboard navigation more efficient. Users should not have to tab through multiple links that serve a similar purpose or direct to closely related destinations.

## Why This Matters?

When adjacent links are combined into a single CTA, it reduces the cognitive load on users, especially those who rely on keyboard navigation. This improvement makes the experience more streamlined and helps users navigate efficiently without unnecessary repetition or confusion.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure the design consolidates adjacent links into a single, clear, and descriptive CTA where possible.

- **Developer:** Implement the combined CTA as a single focusable element and test the keyboard navigation to ensure it meets accessibility requirements.

- **Product Owner:** Review and ensure that combining CTAs aligns with the user experience and accessibility goals for the product.

## Example:

- Instead of having separate links for “Learn More” and “Read Full Article” next to each other, combine them into a single, more descriptive link like “Learn More About This Topic.”
