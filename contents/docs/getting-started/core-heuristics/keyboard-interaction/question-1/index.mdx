title: Question 1
description: Are adjacent links pointing to unique locations combined into a single CTA?
---

## Description

This questions ensures that all interactive elements are accessible and operable using the keyboard without unnecessary TAB stops or inefficient navigation.

## Requirement for Success

- Minimize TAB stops by combining adjacent links (such as images and text) into a single, clear CTA. Users should only need to focus on one element when multiple links lead to the same destination.

## Why This Matters?

When adjacent links point to the same location (e.g., an image and a text link both leading to the full article), having multiple focusable elements creates unnecessary stops in the navigation sequence. This can slow down keyboard users and cause confusion. By combining these links into a single CTA, navigation becomes smoother and more intuitive.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that related links (e.g., an article image and headline) are combined into a single clickable area, eliminating redundancy in the design.

- **Developer:** Implement the combined CTA in the code, ensuring that both the image and text can be accessed as a single link.

- **Product Owner:** Ensure the change aligns with the overall user experience and supports a more efficient keyboard navigation journey.

## Examples:

- An article preview with an image link and a text link both leading to the full article. Instead of having separate focusable elements, combine them into one.

- A navigation menu with adjacent buttons that both lead to the same settings page should be reduced to a single button for clarity and efficiency.
