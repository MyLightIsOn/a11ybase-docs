## Overview

**Keyboard Interaction** is one of the most important aspects of accessibility. Many users, including those with physical disabilities, rely on keyboards or alternative input devices to navigate and interact with digital products. Ensuring that all interactive elements are fully operable via the keyboard is crucial for providing an inclusive user experience.

This heuristic helps teams design components that are free from **keyboard traps**, have logical **tabbing orders**, and provide clear **focus indicators**. By following the principles of keyboard interaction, teams can ensure that users who can't or prefer not to use a mouse can still access and enjoy all features of a product.

## Why Keyboard Accessibility Matters

- Many users rely on keyboards as their primary input method.
- Keyboard navigation is **required** to navigate with assistive technology.
- Improves usability for power users who prefer keyboard shortcuts.
- Keyboard accessibility benefits all users, enhancing overall usability.

## Questions for Keyboard Interaction Heuristics

The following heuristics form the foundation of keyboard accessibility in A11yBase. Each heuristic is accompanied by a series of questions to guide your design decisions:

- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-1">Question 1:</a>** Is there a skip-to-main-content link provided?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-2">Question 2:</a>** Are we avoiding keyboard traps?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-3">Question 3:</a>**  Is tabbing order predictable, logical, and intuitive?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-4">Question 4:</a>** Is the focus indicator clearly visible when active elements receive focus?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-5">Question 5:</a>** Are buttons, links, and other CTAs designed to consider both hover and focus states?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-6">Question 6:</a>** Are all buttons, links, and interactive components fully operable using only a keyboard?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-7">Question 7:</a>** Does focus automatically shift to newly opened modals or popups, and return to the previous element when they are closed?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-8">Question 8:</a>** Are adjacent links, such as images and text links, that point to the same location combined into a single CTA?
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/question-9">Question 9:</a>** Can single-character shortcuts be turned off or remapped, or are they only triggered when the relevant control has focus?
