## What are Accessibility Heuristics?

Accessibility heuristics are a set of principles or rules designed to ensure that digital interfaces are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or impairments. These heuristics serve as guidelines for creating inclusive designs and building accessible digital products, ensuring that key aspects such as navigation, interaction, and readability are addressed with accessibility in mind.

## The Role of Heuristics in A11yBase

A11yBase is built upon core accessibility heuristics that serve as the foundation for every component, pattern, and interaction within the system. These heuristics guide the creation and evaluation of components to ensure they meet the necessary accessibility standards, specifically aligned with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

By embedding these heuristics into the design system, A11yBase ensures that:

- **Designers:** can follow best practices for creating accessible, user-friendly interfaces.

- **Developers:** can build components that are fully operable, perceivable, and understandable by all users, including those with disabilities.

- **Product Teams:** can gradually adopt accessibility principles, starting with the most essential heuristics and building a more inclusive product over time.

## The Purpose of Heuristics in A11yBase

The accessibility heuristics in A11yBase are not just rules; they are practical, actionable guidelines. They serve three key purposes:

- **Ensure Compliance:** Heuristics help teams ensure that their designs meet accessibility standards (such as WCAG 2.1), making them compliant with legal and ethical guidelines.

- **Enhance Usability:** By following these heuristics, products become more usable for all users, including those with different physical, sensory, and cognitive abilities..

- **Promote Incremental Learning:** Heuristics allow teams to focus on one aspect of accessibility at a time. This incremental approach lowers the barrier to entry, making accessibility less overwhelming and more achievable.

## How Heuristics Work in A11yBase

Each component in A11yBase is evaluated against a set of core heuristics to ensure it is accessible by default. These heuristics are mapped to specific WCAG success criteria, providing a direct connection between practical design decisions and globally recognized accessibility standards.

For example:

- A button component is evaluated based on heuristics such as keyboard interaction, screen reader support, and contrast and readability.

- Each heuristic is associated with specific WCAG criteria, such as 2.1.1 Keyboard (making sure that the button is fully operable via keyboard) and 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (ensuring that the button’s text is readable).


## The Six Core Heuristics of A11yBase

The core accessibility heuristics of A11yBase cover a wide range of accessibility concerns, ensuring that every user can interact with a product effectively. These heuristics include:

- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction">Keyboard Interaction:</a>** Ensures that all interactive elements, such as buttons and forms, are operable using only the keyboard.
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction">Screen Reader Support:</a>** Focuses on making non-text elements (such as images and icons) identifiable and accessible to screen readers.
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction">Page Structure:</a>** Emphasizes the importance of having a logical and accessible page structure, with clear headings and a logical flow.
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction">Meaningful Content:</a>** Focuses on making sure that all information, including errors and critical feedback, is conveyed in a meaningful way to users.
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction">Readability:</a>** Ensures that text is clear, readable, and understandable for users with varying levels of ability.
- **<a href="/docs/getting-started/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction">User Quality of Life (QOL):</a>** User Quality of Life (QOL): Ensures that the design accommodates user needs, making their overall experience more intuitive and pleasant.

These heuristics are the pillars of A11yBase, guiding the design and development of every component.

### Continuous Learning Through Heuristics

The design and development teams working with A11yBase will not just follow these heuristics—they will learn through them. Every component includes detailed documentation that explains the why behind each heuristic, offering teams the chance to build their understanding of accessibility as they implement the design system.
