A11yBase is a design system and educational tool for designers and developers that want to get better at accessibility.


## Why I Created A11yBase

My primary motivation for building this design system is twofold: to deepen my own understanding of creating one from the ground up and to facilitate learning around inclusive design and development for myself and others.

As an accessibility program manager at two enterprise SaaS companies, I’ve witnessed firsthand how accessibility is often perceived as a complex, niche area, understood by only a few. This misconception leads many teams to shy away from investing time in it.

Through A11yBase, I aim to create a practical guide that introduces accessibility to product teams in a more approachable way. Accessibility principles don’t need to be learned all at once; they can be adopted incrementally. This allows teams to progress at their own pace, lowering the barrier to entry and fostering a more sustainable learning process.

The foundation of A11yBase is built on top of accessibilty heuristics, which I will explain next.
