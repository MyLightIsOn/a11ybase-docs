description: An introduction to the A11yBase design system.

A11yBase is a design system and educational tool created for designers and developers who seek to improve their understanding and application of accessibility in digital products. It serves as both a practical resource and a learning guide, equipping product teams with the foundational knowledge and tools to build more inclusive user interfaces.


## Why I Created A11yBase

The motivation behind building A11yBase is twofold:

- **To deepen personal knowledge of design systems:** The process of creating A11yBase is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in developing a design system from the ground up.

- **To foster inclusive design and development:** A11yBase serves as a resource for others to learn about accessibility. It aims to simplify the learning curve for designers and developers who may feel overwhelmed by the perceived complexity of accessibility.

As an accessibility program manager at two enterprise SaaS companies, I’ve observed that accessibility is often perceived as a niche, complex field, understood by only a few. This misconception leads many teams to deprioritize or avoid investing the necessary time and effort in making their products accessible. A11yBase seeks to change that narrative.

## Mission of A11yBase

The mission of A11yBase is to make accessibility approachable and incremental. By breaking down accessibility into manageable pieces, teams can gradually integrate best practices without feeling overwhelmed. This approach allows product teams to adopt accessibility principles at their own pace, fostering a sustainable, long-term commitment to inclusivity.

A11yBase is built around core accessibility heuristics, making it a tool that not only provides reusable components but also teaches teams why and how to make their products accessible. By embedding accessibility into the design process, A11yBase reduces barriers to adoption and empowers teams to create inclusive experiences for all users.

## Who is A11yBase For?

A11yBase is designed for:
- **Designers:** Those who want to create accessible experiences and dive deeper into inclusive design.

- **Developers:** Teams looking for accessible, reusable components with best practices built-in.

- **Product Teams:** Those looking to enhance their products’ overall usability ala the <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/the-digital-curb-cut-effect-the-universal-benefits-of-web-accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curb Cut Effect</a>

Whether you’re just beginning to explore accessibility or are looking to fine-tune your knowledge, A11yBase offers guidance and resources that support learning and implementation at every level.

## What A11yBase is NOT

<b>A11yBase is NOT replace or substitute of the WCAG or any other established standard.</b> It's not even a standard at all. It's one of many tools that a person could use when trying to learn about digital accessibility.
