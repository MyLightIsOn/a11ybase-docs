title: What A11yBase is NOT
description: Limitations of A11yBase
---

A11yBase is **not** a replacement for established accessibility standards like **WCAG**, **Section 508**, or any other legal or compliance frameworks. It does not serve as a formal standard or certification for accessibility.

Instead, A11yBase is a **supplementary tool** designed to help teams understand and apply accessibility principles incrementally. While it offers guidelines and heuristics to improve accessibility, it is not a substitute for comprehensive audits or formal compliance assessments.

A11yBase is meant to guide product teams through the process of making their products more accessible over time. It focuses on fostering better practices, learning, and awareness, rather than providing a definitive checklist for legal or compliance purposes. Teams should continue to reference recognized standards and ensure their products meet all necessary legal requirements.
