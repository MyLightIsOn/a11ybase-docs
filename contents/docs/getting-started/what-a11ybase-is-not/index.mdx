title: What A11yBase is NOT
description: Limitations of A11yBase
---

A11yBase is meant to guide product teams through the process of making their products more accessible over time. It focuses on fostering better practices, learning, and awareness, rather than providing a definitive checklist for legal or compliance purposes. Here's what it is not.

- A11yBase is **NOT** a replacement for established accessibility standards like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a>, <a href="https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/section-508-law/">Section 508</a> any other legal or compliance frameworks.
- It is **NOT** a new standard, nor is it a standard at all.
- It does **NOT** cover all aspects of digital accessibility.
- It will **NOT** make you an expert.
- It is **NOT** a replacemenet for user testing.

Instead, A11yBase is a **supplementary tool** designed to help teams understand and apply accessibility principles incrementally. While it offers guidelines and heuristics to improve accessibility, it is not a substitute for comprehensive audits or formal compliance assessments. Teams should continue to reference recognized standards and ensure their products meet all necessary legal requirements.
