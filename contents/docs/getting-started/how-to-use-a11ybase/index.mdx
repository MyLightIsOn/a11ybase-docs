A11yBase provides a practical, step-by-step process to improve the accessibility of your designs and components. Follow this example to see how you can apply it to your project:

### Step 1: Review the Core Heuristics

Start by reviewing the six core heuristics in A11yBase: <a href="core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/overview">keyboard interaction</a>, <a href="core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/overview">screen reader support</a>, <a href="core-heuristics/page-structure/overview">page structure</a>, <a href="core-heuristics/readability/overview">readability</a>, <a href="core-heuristics/meaningful-content/overview">meaningful content</a>, and <a href="core-heuristics/user-qol/overview">user quality of life</a>.

### Step 2: Select a Component to Evaluate

Choose a component or interface element that you want to evaluate for accessibility. For this example, let’s select a **form button**.

-- Add an image of a form with a button (e.g., "Submit") for context.

### Step 3: Apply Heuristic Questions

Go through the heuristic questions related to **keyboard interaction**:
1. Can the button be activated with the keyboard?
2. Does the button have a visible focus indicator when tabbed to?
3. Is there a predictable tab order leading to the button?

Answer each question based on your component’s behavior. If the answer is "no," this indicates an area for improvement.

-- Add an image showing a keyboard user navigating to the button with a visible focus indicator.

### Step 4: Make Improvements

If you identified any issues, work with your team to resolve them. For example, if the button doesn't show a focus indicator, ensure that the CSS includes styles for focus states.

-- Add an image showing code snippets or before-and-after improvements to the button’s focus state.

### Step 5: Test with Assistive Technologies

After making updates, test the component with assistive technologies like a screen reader and keyboard. Ensure that it functions as expected.

-- Add an image showing a user testing with a screen reader or keyboard.

### Step 6: Repeat for Other Heuristics

Once you've evaluated the component for keyboard interaction, move on to the other heuristics like **screen reader support** and **meaningful content**. Continue applying the heuristic questions to improve accessibility step by step.

-- Add an image summarizing the process of moving from one heuristic to the next.

By following these steps, A11yBase helps teams methodically improve accessibility in a structured, incremental way.
