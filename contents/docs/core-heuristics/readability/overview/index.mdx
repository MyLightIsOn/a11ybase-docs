## Overview

**Readability** focuses on ensuring that text and visual elements are easy to read and understand, regardless of the user’s abilities or environmental factors. This involves maintaining sufficient contrast, allowing users to adjust text size, and ensuring that meaning is not conveyed through color alone. Making sure that content is readable benefits users with visual impairments, cognitive disabilities, or those accessing content in challenging environments.

This heuristic helps teams design with principles of **text contrast**, **line spacing**, and **zoom functionality** in mind. By following readability guidelines, teams can make sure that users can comfortably read and comprehend the content, no matter their circumstances.

## Why Readability Matters

- Clear, readable content is essential for users with visual and cognitive impairments.
- Adequate contrast and font size help users in all environments, including those with low lighting or bright screens.
- Helps users who rely on screen magnifiers or those who need adjustable text sizes for comfort.
- Readability enhances overall user experience by reducing visual strain and improving comprehension.

## Questions for Readability Heuristics

The following heuristics form the foundation of readability accessibility in A11yBase. Each heuristic is accompanied by a series of questions to guide your design decisions:

- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/question-1">Question 1:</a>** Can users pinch to zoom on touch screens?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/question-2">Question 2:</a>** Do important non-text components have at least a 3 to 1 contrast with the background?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/question-3">Question 3:</a>** Do links without an underline have an additional visual cue to identify them as links?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/question-4">Question 4:</a>** Does text have sufficient color contrast with the background?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/question-5">Question 5:</a>** Is meaning that is conveyed through color also presented in a way that does not depend on color?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/question-6">Question 6:</a>** Is the line spacing at least 1.5 times the font size and is the spacing between paragraphs at least 2 times the font size?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/question-7">Question 7:</a>** Do complex images and charts have a long description?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/question-8">Question 8:</a>** Does newly displayed content remain visible until it’s no longer needed?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/question-9">Question 9:</a>** Are users forced to use the interface in only portrait or only landscape orientation?
