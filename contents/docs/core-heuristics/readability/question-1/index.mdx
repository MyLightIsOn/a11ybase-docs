title: Can users pinch to zoom on touch screens?
description: Readability - Question 1
---

## Description

Ensures that users can use pinch-to-zoom gestures on touch screens to resize content, allowing them to view and interact with content more easily.

## Why This Matters?

Pinch-to-zoom is an essential feature for users with visual impairments, enabling them to adjust text and images to a comfortable size. Disabling this feature can make content difficult to read and navigate, especially on smaller screens.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine browsing a website on your phone, but youâ€™re unable to zoom in to see small text or details in images. For users with visual impairments, this restriction makes it impossible to interact with the content comfortably.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Avoid disabling pinch-to-zoom on touch interfaces and ensure that text and images are scalable.

- **Developer:** Ensure that the viewport meta tag does not restrict zooming capabilities. Avoid using `user-scalable=no` in the meta viewport settings.

## Examples:
