title: Do complex images and charts have a long description?
description: Readability - Question 7
---

## Description

Ensures that complex images, such as charts, graphs, or diagrams, are accompanied by a long description that provides a detailed explanation of the content for users who cannot view the image.

## Why This Matters?

Long descriptions for complex images help users with visual impairments, cognitive disabilities, or those relying on screen readers to understand the information conveyed by the image. Without a long description, key data and insights may be inaccessible to these users.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine encountering a detailed chart or diagram on a webpage, but as a screen reader user, you receive no information about the content. Without a long description, you would miss out on important insights and context from the image.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Design charts, graphs, and other complex images with accompanying long descriptions that explain the content in detail.

- **Developer:** Use accessible techniques such as the `<figure>` element with a `<figcaption>` or ARIA descriptions to provide detailed long descriptions for complex images and charts.

## Examples:
