title: Readability Question 8
description: Does newly displayed content remain visible until it’s no longer needed?
---

## Description

Ensures that newly displayed content, such as popups, alerts, or modals, remains visible long enough for users to read and interact with it, and does not disappear prematurely.

## Why This Matters?

Content that disappears too quickly can cause frustration, especially for users with cognitive or motor impairments, or those using screen readers. Giving users enough time to read and interact with new content ensures they can process and respond to important information.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine a notification or alert appearing on a page, but it disappears before you have time to read it. For users with slower reading speeds or who rely on assistive technologies, this can result in missed information and a frustrating experience.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that any newly displayed content remains visible until it’s no longer needed or until the user dismisses it manually.

- **Developer:** Implement logic that ensures new content, such as modals, alerts, or notifications, remains visible long enough for users to read and interact with it, or provide manual dismiss options.

## Examples:
