title: Readability Question 5
description: Is meaning that is conveyed through color also presented in a way that does not depend on color?
---

## Description

Ensures that information communicated through color is also presented in a non-color-dependent way, such as with text labels, icons, or patterns, to accommodate users with color vision deficiencies.

## Why This Matters?

Relying solely on color to convey meaning can exclude users with color blindness or visual impairments. Providing additional cues ensures that all users can understand the content and perform tasks without relying on color recognition.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a form where required fields are marked only in red, but you are colorblind. Without other indicators, such as asterisks or text, you wouldn't know which fields are required, leading to confusion and errors.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that any information conveyed through color is also presented with non-color indicators, such as text labels or icons.

- **Developer:** Implement non-color-dependent cues, such as additional text, patterns, or icons, to reinforce meaning beyond color alone.

## Examples:
