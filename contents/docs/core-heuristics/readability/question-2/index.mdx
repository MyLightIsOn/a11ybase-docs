title: Readability Question 2
description: Do important non-text components have at least a 3 to 1 contrast with the background?
---

## Description

Ensures that important non-text elements, such as buttons, icons, and other interactive components, have sufficient contrast with the background to make them easily visible and distinguishable.

## Why This Matters?

Low-contrast non-text components can be difficult to see, especially for users with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies. Ensuring at least a 3:1 contrast ratio improves visibility and helps all users interact with these elements effectively.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine trying to interact with a button or icon that blends into the background because of low contrast. For users with visual impairments, this makes it challenging to identify interactive components, hindering their ability to use the interface.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that non-text components like buttons, icons, and other important elements have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with the background.

- **Developer:** Use CSS to maintain sufficient contrast between non-text components and the background. Implement tools to check and verify contrast ratios.

## Examples:
