title: Readability Question 3
description: Do links without an underline have an additional visual cue to identify them as links?
---

## Description

Ensures that links that are not underlined have other visual cues, such as color changes, bold text, or icons, to make them identifiable as clickable elements.

## Why This Matters?

Links that are not underlined can be difficult for users to recognize as interactive elements, especially for those with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies. Adding additional visual cues helps users understand which elements are links.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine browsing a webpage where links blend into the text without any visual indicators. Without clear cues, you would have trouble identifying which elements are interactive, leading to confusion and missed opportunities for navigation.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that links that are not underlined have other visual cues, such as color contrast, bold text, or icons, to distinguish them from regular text.

- **Developer:** Implement CSS styles to provide additional visual cues for links without underlines, ensuring they remain easily identifiable.

## Examples:
