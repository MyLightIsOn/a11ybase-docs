title: Are users forced to use the interface in only portrait or only landscape orientation?
description: Readability - Question 9
---

## Description

Ensures that users are not forced to use the interface in a single orientation (portrait or landscape) and that they can switch between orientations based on their preference or device usage.

## Why This Matters?

Some users may prefer or require a specific orientation based on their device or accessibility needs. Restricting the interface to one orientation can make it difficult for users with certain physical or cognitive disabilities to interact with the content comfortably.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a tablet or mobile device, and you prefer holding it in landscape mode for ease of use. If the app or website forces you to use it in portrait mode, it disrupts your experience, making the interface harder to interact with.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Design layouts that adapt to both portrait and landscape orientations, ensuring that the content remains usable and accessible in either mode.

- **Developer:** Implement responsive designs and ensure that the interface can switch seamlessly between portrait and landscape orientations without loss of functionality or readability.

## Examples:
