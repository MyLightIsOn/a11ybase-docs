title: Does text have sufficient color contrast with the background?
description: Readability - Question 4
---

## Description

Ensures that all text has sufficient color contrast with the background to be easily readable, especially for users with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies.

## Why This Matters?

Low-contrast text can be difficult to read, making it inaccessible to many users. Ensuring sufficient color contrast helps all users, including those with low vision or color blindness, to access and understand the content.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine trying to read a website where the text blends into the background due to low contrast. For users with visual impairments, this makes the content unreadable and the website unusable.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Choose color combinations that provide sufficient contrast between text and background, following WCAG guidelines for contrast ratios.

- **Developer:** Use CSS to maintain appropriate contrast levels between text and background, and test with contrast-checking tools to ensure compliance.

## Examples:
