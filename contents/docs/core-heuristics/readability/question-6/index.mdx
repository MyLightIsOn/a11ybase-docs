---

## Description

Ensures that line spacing and paragraph spacing are sufficient to improve readability and reduce visual strain, especially for users with visual or cognitive impairments.

## Why This Matters?

Adequate line spacing and paragraph spacing make content easier to read by preventing text from feeling cramped or overwhelming. This helps users, including those with dyslexia or other reading difficulties, process and understand content more effectively.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine trying to read a document with very little space between lines or paragraphs. The text feels cramped and difficult to follow, leading to frustration and making it harder to comprehend the content.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that line spacing is set to at least 1.5 times the font size and paragraph spacing is at least 2 times the font size to enhance readability.

- **Developer:** Use CSS to set appropriate line-height and margin-bottom values for text elements, ensuring proper spacing for readability.
