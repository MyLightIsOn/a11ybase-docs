title: Keyboard Interaction Question 1
description: Is there a skip-to-main-content link provided?
---
## Description

Ensures users can bypass repetitive content, such as navigation menus, to quickly access the main content.

## Why This Matters?

A skip-to-main-content link improves usability for keyboard-only users by saving them from tabbing through repeated navigation. It ensures a more efficient experience.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a website with a keyboard and needing to press "tab" repeatedly to skip menus and other repetitive elements. A skip link allows users to directly access important content without frustration.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure the skip-to-main-content link is placed visibly at the start of the page and works with various layouts.

- **Developer:** Ensure the skip-to-main-content link is operable and jumps to the correct content area, using accessible HTML/ARIA attributes.
