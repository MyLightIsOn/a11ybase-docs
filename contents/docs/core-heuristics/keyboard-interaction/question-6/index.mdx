title: Keyboard Interaction Question 6
description: Are all buttons, links, and interactive components fully operable using only a keyboard?
---

## Description

Ensures that all interactive elements, including buttons, links, and forms, can be used without a mouse and are fully functional through keyboard interaction.

## Why This Matters?

Some users rely solely on keyboards to navigate and interact with websites. If interactive elements are not accessible via keyboard, it prevents these users from completing important tasks or engaging with the content.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine you're unable to use a mouse and must navigate a website using only your keyboard. If buttons, links, or form elements arenâ€™t accessible via keyboard, it creates a roadblock, making it impossible for you to complete essential tasks like submitting a form or navigating to a different page.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure all interactive elements are clearly designed with keyboard functionality in mind. Consider how users will tab to and interact with each component.

- **Developer:** Ensure all buttons, links, and interactive elements can be activated via keyboard (`Enter` for buttons, `Space` or `Enter` for links) and use semantic HTML to ensure proper keyboard interaction.
