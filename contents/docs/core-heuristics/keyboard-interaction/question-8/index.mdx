title: Keyboard Interaction Question 8
description: Are adjacent links, such as images and text links, that point to the same location combined into a single CTA?
---

## Description

Ensures that links pointing to the same destination are combined into a single clickable element (CTA) to reduce confusion and improve keyboard navigation.

## Why This Matters?

When adjacent links (like an image and its associated text) point to the same location but are separate elements, keyboard users must tab through each one, leading to redundant navigation. Combining them into a single CTA streamlines the experience and reduces unnecessary tabbing.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine tabbing through a webpage where both an image and its associated text link are separate clickable elements, leading you to the same page. This means double the work for keyboard users who must tab through each link unnecessarily, creating a frustrating and repetitive experience.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Design adjacent clickable elements (such as images and text links) to act as a unified call-to-action, both visually and functionally.

- **Developer:** Combine adjacent clickable elements pointing to the same location into a single, accessible link using proper HTML and ARIA attributes.
