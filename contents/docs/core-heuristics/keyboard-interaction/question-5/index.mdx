title: Keyboard Interaction Question 5
description: Are buttons, links, and other CTAs designed to consider both hover and focus states?
---

## Description

Ensures that interactive elements like buttons and links provide clear visual feedback for both hover and focus states, catering to mouse and keyboard users alike.

## Why This Matters?

While hover states provide feedback for mouse users, focus states are equally important for keyboard users. Without a distinct visual cue for focus states, keyboard users might not know which element is active, leading to poor navigation and interaction experiences.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine tabbing through a website's buttons and links, but the elements don't visibly change when they receive focus. As a keyboard user, you would be left guessing which item is currently selected, leading to confusion and errors.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that hover and focus states are visually distinct and accessible. Focus indicators should work well in conjunction with hover effects and fit the overall design.

- **Developer:** Implement CSS styles that differentiate between hover and focus states. Ensure that focus states are clearly visible and distinct from hover states, and donâ€™t rely on hover alone to indicate interactivity.
