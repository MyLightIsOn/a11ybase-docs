title: Keyboard Interaction Question 3
description: Is tabbing order predictable, logical, and intuitive?
---

## Description

Ensures that the sequence in which focusable elements are navigated through using the "Tab" key follows a logical and intuitive order, matching the layout.

## Why This Matters?

An illogical tab order can confuse keyboard users and disrupt the flow of navigation. Proper tabbing order ensures that users can move seamlessly through the page, from top to bottom and left to right, without unexpected jumps.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine trying to fill out a form where pressing "Tab" moves you to random parts of the page instead of the next form field. This inconsistent flow creates a frustrating experience and makes it harder to complete tasks.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that the visual layout corresponds with the natural flow of tabbing, moving from top to bottom and left to right.

- **Developer:** Ensure that tabbing order follows the expected flow by utilizing proper HTML structure or adjusting the tab order programmatically where necessary (using `tabindex`).
