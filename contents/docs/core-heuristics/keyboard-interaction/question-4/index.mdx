title: Is the focus indicator clearly visible when active elements receive focus?
description: Keyboard Interaction - Question 4
---

## Description

Ensures that interactive elements visually indicate when they receive keyboard focus, helping users know where they are on the page.

## Why This Matters?

Without a visible focus indicator, keyboard users may struggle to navigate through a page, as they wonâ€™t be able to see which element is currently focused. A clear focus indicator improves usability and ensures users can interact confidently with the interface.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a webpage with a keyboard, but you can't see where the focus is as you tab through links and buttons. Without a visible focus indicator, users become disoriented and unsure of what actions they are performing, leading to confusion and errors.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure focus indicators are visually distinct and fit within the design. Consider how focus looks in both normal and high-contrast modes.

- **Developer:** Implement custom focus styles if necessary, using CSS, but ensure they are always visible. Avoid removing the default browser focus styles unless replaced with an equally clear visual cue.
