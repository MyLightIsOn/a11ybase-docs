## Description

Ensures users can navigate in and out of interactive elements like forms, modals, and menus without getting trapped, allowing smooth keyboard navigation.

## Why This Matters?

Keyboard traps prevent users from moving past or exiting certain elements, which can result in frustration and inaccessible experiences, especially for users relying solely on keyboard input.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine you're filling out a form, but when you press "tab" to move to the next field, you become stuck, unable to move forward or back. Without the ability to escape, the user is effectively blocked from continuing their interaction with the page.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that interactive elements, like forms or modals, are designed to allow users to exit or move to the next element easily.

- **Developer:** Ensure that no interactive component creates a keyboard trap by providing clear focus management, escape options, and ensuring proper tabbing flow.

## Examples:
