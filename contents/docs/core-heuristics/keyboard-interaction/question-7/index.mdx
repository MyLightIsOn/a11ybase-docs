title: Does focus automatically shift to newly opened modals or popups, and return to the previous element when they are closed?
description: Keyboard Interaction - Question 7
---

## Description

Ensures that focus moves to modals or popups when they are opened and returns to the previous element when they are closed, maintaining logical keyboard navigation.

## Why This Matters?

Without proper focus management, keyboard users may lose track of where they are when interacting with modals or popups. This can lead to confusion and difficulty in navigating the page.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine opening a modal using only a keyboard, but focus doesn’t shift into the modal. You can’t interact with the modal’s contents, and when you close it, you don’t know where your focus has gone. This creates a frustrating experience and makes the content inaccessible.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Consider how modals and popups will appear and disappear without disrupting the user’s focus. Make sure they are visually and functionally clear.

- **Developer:** Implement proper focus management by ensuring that when a modal or popup is opened, focus is trapped within it, and when it is closed, focus returns to the element that triggered it.
