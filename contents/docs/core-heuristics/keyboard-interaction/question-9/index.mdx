title: Keyboard Interaction Question 9
description: Can single-character shortcuts be turned off or remapped, or are they only triggered when the relevant control has focus?
---

## Description

Ensures that single-character shortcuts can be disabled or remapped, or are only active when the relevant control has focus, to prevent accidental activation.

## Why This Matters?

Single-character shortcuts can cause accidental actions if triggered unintentionally. Allowing users to turn them off, remap them, or restrict them to focused elements prevents frustrating mistakes and enhances usability for keyboard users.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a web application where pressing a single character accidentally triggers actions while you're typing, navigating, or working. Without the ability to disable or remap these shortcuts, the experience becomes unpredictable and prone to errors, making it difficult for users relying on the keyboard to interact smoothly.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Be aware of how single-character shortcuts impact users, particularly those who rely on keyboards for navigation and interaction. Ensure that shortcuts are clearly communicated and can be disabled or remapped.

- **Developer:** Implement functionality that allows users to disable or remap single-character shortcuts. Ensure shortcuts are only active when the relevant control is in focus to avoid unintended actions.
