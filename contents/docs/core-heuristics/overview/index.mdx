## The Six Core Heuristics of A11yBase

The core accessibility heuristics of A11yBase cover a wide range of accessibility concerns, ensuring that every user can interact with a product effectively. These heuristics include:

- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/keyboard-interaction/overview">Keyboard Interaction:</a>** Ensures that all interactive elements, such as buttons and forms, are operable using only the keyboard.
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/overview">Screen Reader Support:</a>** Focuses on making non-text elements (such as images and icons) identifiable and accessible to screen readers.
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/overview">Page Structure:</a>** Emphasizes the importance of having a logical and accessible page structure, with clear headings and a logical flow.
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/meningful-content/overview">Meaningful Content:</a>** Focuses on making sure that all information, including errors and critical feedback, is conveyed in a meaningful way to users.
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/readability/overview">Readability:</a>** Ensures that text is clear, readable, and understandable for users with varying levels of ability.
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/user-qol/overview">User Quality of Life (QOL):</a>** User Quality of Life (QOL): Ensures that the design accommodates user needs, making their overall experience more intuitive and pleasant.

These heuristics are the pillars of A11yBase, guiding the design and development of every component.
