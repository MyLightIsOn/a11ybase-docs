title: Are the main page language and language changes correctly designated for assistive technologies?
description: Screen Reader Support - Question 8
---

## Description

Ensures that the main language of the page is correctly set and any language changes within the content are properly identified, so assistive technologies can announce them accurately.

## Why This Matters?

Screen readers rely on language settings to pronounce content correctly. If the page language or in-content language changes are not marked, users may hear incorrect pronunciations or confusing content, reducing the overall accessibility of the page.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a screen reader thatâ€™s set to read content in English, but a section of the page switches to another language without warning. The screen reader continues reading it in English, causing confusion and making the text unintelligible.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Consider the language requirements of the content and ensure any language changes within the design are planned and communicated to developers.

- **Developer:** Set the primary language of the document using the `lang` attribute (`<html lang="en">`), and ensure language changes within the content are marked using the appropriate `lang` attribute at the element level.

## Examples:
