title: Screen Reader Support Question 3
description: Is visual and auditory information presented in text format?
---

## Description

Ensures that important visual and auditory content is also available in text format, making it accessible to users relying on screen readers or other assistive technologies.

## Why This Matters?

Screen readers cannot interpret visual or auditory content like images or sounds. Without accompanying text descriptions, users who rely on assistive technologies may miss out on key information, making the content inaccessible.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a webpage where important information is only conveyed through images or audio, but there are no text descriptions. As a user relying on a screen reader, you would miss out on crucial details, leaving you confused and unable to fully engage with the content.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that visual and auditory elements are supplemented with descriptive text that conveys the same information.

- **Developer:** Implement appropriate alternative text for visual elements and ensure auditory content is accompanied by transcripts or captions for users of assistive technologies.

## Examples:
