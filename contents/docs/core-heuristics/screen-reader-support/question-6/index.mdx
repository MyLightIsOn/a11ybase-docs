title: Are groupings and other navigation mechanisms presented using lists?
description: Screen Reader Support - Question 6
---

## Description

Ensures that groupings of related elements, such as menus or navigation items, are correctly structured using semantic lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) to improve screen reader navigation.

## Why This Matters?

Using lists to group related items helps screen reader users navigate more efficiently. Without proper semantic grouping, users may find it difficult to understand the structure of the content or navigate menus effectively.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a website with a screen reader where the navigation menu isnâ€™t properly structured with lists. Instead of hearing a logical grouping of items, you hear a disjointed series of links, making it difficult to understand the relationships between the items and navigate effectively.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that related items, such as navigation links or options in dropdown menus, are grouped logically and visually for better understanding.

- **Developer:** Use semantic HTML lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) to group related navigation items, menus, and other groupings to improve the structure and screen reader navigation experience.
