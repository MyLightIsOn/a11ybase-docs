title: Screen Reader Support Question 2
description: Are decorative images identified and marked in a way that they can be ignored by assistive technologies?
---

## Description

Ensures that decorative images, which do not provide meaningful content, are marked to be ignored by screen readers, preventing unnecessary distractions.

## Why This Matters?

Decorative images that do not add any information to the content can clutter the experience for screen reader users. If these images are not properly hidden from assistive technologies, users might hear irrelevant descriptions, interrupting the flow of information.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a screen reader and encountering multiple decorative images that are described, even though they donâ€™t add value to the content. This becomes overwhelming and frustrating, as it distracts from the important information on the page.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Identify which images are purely decorative and should be hidden from screen readers by marking them appropriately during the design process.

- **Developer:** Implement proper alt attributes, such as `alt=""`, or use ARIA-hidden attributes (`aria-hidden="true"`) to ensure that decorative images are ignored by screen readers.
