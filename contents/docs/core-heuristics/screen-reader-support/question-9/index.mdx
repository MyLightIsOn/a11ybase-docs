title: Screen Reader Support Question 9
description: Do data tables have meaningful semantic column and row headers as well as a table name?
---

## Description

Ensures that data tables are structured with meaningful row and column headers, as well as a table name, so screen readers can correctly interpret and convey the information.

## Why This Matters?

Screen readers rely on semantic structure to interpret and navigate data tables. Without properly labeled headers or a descriptive table name, users may struggle to understand the data’s organization and meaning.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine trying to interpret a data table using a screen reader, but the headers and table name are missing. As you navigate through the table, you can hear the data but don’t know what each row or column represents, leaving you confused about the context and relationships in the data.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that data tables are designed with clear headers for rows and columns, and provide space for a table name to describe the content.

- **Developer:** Use semantic HTML to structure tables correctly. Mark headers using `<th>` elements with appropriate `scope` attributes (`row` or `col`), and ensure the table is given a descriptive name using captions or ARIA labels.
