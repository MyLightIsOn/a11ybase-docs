## Overview

**Screen Reader Support** is vital for making digital products accessible to users with visual impairments. Screen readers translate on-screen content into speech or braille, allowing users to navigate and interact with websites and applications. Ensuring that content is structured correctly and interactive elements are labeled properly is key to providing an inclusive experience for screen reader users.

This heuristic helps teams design interfaces that provide clear **text alternatives**, proper **page structure**, and meaningful **labels** for interactive components. Following screen reader support principles ensures that all visual information is accessible to users who rely on screen readers.

## Why Screen Reader Accessibility Matters

- Many users depend on screen readers to access web content.
- Proper labeling and structure improve overall accessibility.
- Screen reader accessibility ensures inclusivity for blind and visually impaired users.
- Structuring content for screen readers benefits users with cognitive disabilities by providing clear information.

## Questions for Screen Reader Support Heuristics

The following heuristics form the foundation of screen reader accessibility in A11yBase. Each heuristic is accompanied by a series of questions to guide your design decisions:

- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/question-1">Question 1:</a>** Is real text used rather than images of text?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/question-2">Question 2:</a>** Are errors described in text?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/question-3">Question 3:</a>** Are form labels visible and persistent?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/question-4">Question 4:</a>** Are required form fields identified visually and through text?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/question-5">Question 5:</a>** Do form controls have visible, meaningful text labels?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/question-6">Question 6:</a>** Are section headings and form labels meaningful?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/question-7">Question 7:</a>** Is content presented in short blocks of text with headings?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/question-8">Question 8:</a>** Do all links have meaningful link text?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/screen-reader-support/question-9">Question 9:</a>** Are recurring navigation patterns and functionalities presented and labeled consistently throughout the system?
