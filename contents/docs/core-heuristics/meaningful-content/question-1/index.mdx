title: Is real text used rather than images of text?
description: Meaningful Content - Question 1
---

## Description

Ensures that real, selectable text is used instead of images containing text, allowing users to interact with and understand the content more easily.

## Why This Matters?

Text images cannot be resized, searched, or read by screen readers, making them inaccessible to users who rely on assistive technologies. Real text ensures that content is scalable, searchable, and compatible with accessibility tools.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a website with a screen reader, but important information is presented as an image of text. The screen reader cannot read the image, leaving you unaware of critical content. Real text provides equal access to the content for all users.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that real text is used whenever possible. Avoid using images of text, except for decorative purposes, and ensure decorative images are hidden from assistive technologies.

- **Developer:** Use HTML text elements (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<span>`) for all text content. If an image of text is unavoidable, provide meaningful alternative text for screen readers.

## Examples:
