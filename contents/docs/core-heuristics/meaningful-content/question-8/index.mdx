title: Do all links have meaningful link text?
description: Meaningful Content - Question 8
---

## Description

Ensures that links are labeled with meaningful text that describes their destination or action, rather than generic terms like "click here" or "read more," improving accessibility for all users.

## Why This Matters?

Meaningful link text helps users, especially those relying on screen readers, understand the purpose of the link and where it will take them. Generic link text, such as "click here," provides no context, making navigation more difficult and confusing.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a website using a screen reader, and you hear “click here” repeatedly without any indication of where the link will take you. Without meaningful link text, it’s impossible to understand the purpose of the link, leading to frustration and confusion.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that all links are labeled with descriptive text that clearly indicates their destination or purpose. Avoid using generic phrases like "click here" or "read more."

- **Developer:** Implement links with meaningful text in the anchor tags (`<a>`), ensuring that screen readers can convey the link’s purpose to users.
