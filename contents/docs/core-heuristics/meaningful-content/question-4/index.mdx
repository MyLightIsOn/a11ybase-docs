title: Are required form fields identified visually and through text?
description: Meaningful Content - Question 4
---

## Description

Ensures that required form fields are clearly marked, both visually and through text, making it clear to all users which fields must be completed.

## Why This Matters?

Simply marking a required field with a color or symbol might not be enough for users relying on screen readers or those with color vision deficiencies. Adding text-based indicators ensures that all users can easily understand which fields are mandatory.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine completing a form where required fields are marked only with a red asterisk. For users who are colorblind or rely on screen readers, this symbol alone might not be enough to indicate that a field is required, leading to frustration and errors.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that required fields are clearly marked using both visual cues and text, such as labeling fields with "Required" or using symbols with explanatory text.

- **Developer:** Implement both visual and text indicators for required fields using semantic HTML (`<label>`) and ARIA attributes, making sure the required status is communicated to assistive technologies.
