title: Are form labels visible and persistent?
description: Meaningful Content - Question 3
---

## Description

Ensures that form labels are always visible and not hidden or obscured, helping users understand what information is required, even when interacting with the form fields.

## Why This Matters?

Hidden or disappearing form labels can confuse users, especially those relying on screen readers or keyboard navigation. Persistent, visible labels provide clear guidance for users as they navigate forms, ensuring they understand the purpose of each field.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine filling out a form where the label disappears once you start typing. If you forget what the label said, you may be unsure of what information is required. For users relying on screen readers or who tab through fields quickly, this makes completing forms more difficult.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that form labels remain visible at all times, including when users are interacting with form fields. Avoid using placeholder text as a replacement for persistent labels.

- **Developer:** Implement visible and persistent form labels using semantic HTML elements such as `<label>`, ensuring labels remain clear and accessible as users navigate the form.

## Examples:
