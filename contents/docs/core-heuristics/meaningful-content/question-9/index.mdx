title: Meaningful Content Question 9
description: Are recurring navigation patterns and functionalities presented and labeled consistently throughout the system?
---

## Description

Ensures that recurring navigation patterns and interactive functionalities are presented and labeled in a consistent way across the system, helping users navigate and interact with the interface more intuitively.

## Why This Matters?

Consistency in navigation and functionality labeling makes it easier for users, especially those relying on screen readers or other assistive technologies, to understand and predict how elements will behave. Inconsistent patterns can confuse users and lead to frustration.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a system where buttons that perform the same action are labeled differently on different pages, or where navigation changes its layout unpredictably. As a user relying on screen readers, this inconsistency would make it difficult to navigate and interact with the site effectively.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that recurring navigation patterns and functionalities are designed consistently throughout the system. Use the same labels and patterns to maintain predictability for users.

- **Developer:** Implement consistent HTML, ARIA labels, and navigation structures across the system, ensuring that recurring elements behave and are labeled in a uniform way for assistive technologies.
