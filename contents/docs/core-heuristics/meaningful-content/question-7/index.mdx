title: Is content presented in short blocks of text with headings?
description: Meaningful Content - Question 7
---

## Description

Ensures that content is organized into short, manageable blocks of text, each accompanied by meaningful headings, to improve readability and navigation for all users.

## Why This Matters?

Long, unbroken paragraphs can be difficult to read and navigate, especially for users with cognitive disabilities or those using screen readers. Breaking content into short blocks with clear headings helps users find relevant information more easily and improves comprehension.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a long document with a screen reader or trying to read through dense text without clear breaks. Without short blocks of text and headings, it becomes harder to find key information and stay focused on the content.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Structure content into short, digestible paragraphs with meaningful headings, making it easier for users to navigate and comprehend the text.

- **Developer:** Implement proper HTML structure with headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) and paragraphs (`<p>`) to break up content and make it accessible to screen readers.
