title: Meaningful Content Question 2
description: Are errors described in text?
---

## Description

Ensures that errors are clearly described using text, allowing all users, including those using screen readers or other assistive technologies, to understand the issue and how to resolve it.

## Why This Matters?

Error messages that rely solely on visual indicators (e.g., color changes or icons) can be missed by users with visual impairments or those using assistive technologies. Describing errors in text ensures that all users are informed and can take action to fix the problem.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine submitting a form, but you receive no clear text explanation of what went wrong. For users relying on screen readers, errors indicated only by color or icons are impossible to interpret, leaving them confused and unable to complete the task.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that error messages are presented clearly in text, using both visual cues and written explanations to describe the issue and how to resolve it.

- **Developer:** Implement text-based error messages for all forms and actions. Use ARIA attributes where necessary to ensure error messages are announced by screen readers.

## Examples:
