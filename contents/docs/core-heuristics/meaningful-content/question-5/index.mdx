title: Meaningful Content Question 5
description: Do form controls have visible, meaningful text labels?
---

## Description

Ensures that all form controls, such as input fields, checkboxes, and buttons, have visible and meaningful text labels, allowing users to understand their purpose and interact effectively.

## Why This Matters?

Form controls without clear text labels can confuse users, especially those using screen readers or relying on keyboard navigation. Meaningful text labels help users understand the purpose of each control, improving the usability and accessibility of the form.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a form where buttons and input fields are missing clear labels. As a screen reader user, you would struggle to understand the purpose of each control, making it difficult to complete the form without errors.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that all form controls are designed with visible, meaningful text labels that clearly explain their function, avoiding reliance on placeholders or icons alone.

- **Developer:** Implement text labels for all form controls using semantic HTML (`<label>` for input fields and descriptive text for buttons) and ensure that these labels are programmatically associated with the controls.
