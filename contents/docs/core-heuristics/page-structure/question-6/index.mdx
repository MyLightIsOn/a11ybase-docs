title: Are buttons used for CTAs that trigger functionalities within the page?
description: Page Structure - Question 6
---

## Description

Ensures that buttons are used for calls-to-action (CTAs) that perform in-page functionalities, such as submitting forms, opening modals, or triggering actions, rather than for navigation.

## Why This Matters?

Buttons are meant to trigger actions within a page, while links are used for navigation. Using buttons for the correct purpose helps assistive technologies distinguish between actions and navigation, ensuring that users can interact with the page as intended.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a webpage with a screen reader, and buttons are used inconsistently, with some taking you to new pages instead of performing actions. This inconsistency makes it harder to predict the behavior of interactive elements and disrupts your navigation.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Design buttons specifically for actions that occur within the page, such as submitting forms or performing searches, and avoid using them for navigation purposes.

- **Developer:** Implement `<button>` elements for all in-page functionalities, ensuring that buttons are not used for navigation and are clearly distinguishable from links.
