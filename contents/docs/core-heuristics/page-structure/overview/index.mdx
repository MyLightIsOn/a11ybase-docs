## Overview

**Page Structure** plays a critical role in how users, including those with disabilities, navigate and understand the layout of a webpage. Properly structured pages use semantic HTML elements to organize content logically, ensuring that users with screen readers and other assistive technologies can navigate efficiently. A well-organized page structure also helps all users find relevant information quickly and improves the overall user experience.

This heuristic helps teams ensure that content is presented with clear **headings**, proper use of **landmarks**, and logical **navigation elements**. By adhering to these principles, teams can create web pages that are intuitive and easy to navigate for all users.

## Why Page Structure Matters

- A logical page structure improves navigation for all users, especially those using screen readers.
- Proper use of headings and landmarks makes content easier to find and understand.
- Clear navigation helps users avoid confusion and makes it easier to find key information.
- A well-structured page improves overall usability and accessibility.

## Questions for Page Structure Heuristics

The following heuristics form the foundation of page structure accessibility in A11yBase. Each heuristic is accompanied by a series of questions to guide your design decisions:

- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/question-1">Question 1:</a>** Does each page have a meaningful title?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/question-2">Question 2:</a>** Do section headings follow a hierarchical structure and do not skip any levels?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/question-3">Question 3:</a>** Are navigation elements organized in a way that facilitates wayfinding?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/question-4">Question 4:</a>** Is text that looks and acts like a heading marked as a real heading?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/question-5">Question 5:</a>** Is all content placed within a landmark or region?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/question-6">Question 6:</a>** Are buttons used for CTAs that trigger functionalities within the page?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/question-7">Question 7:</a>** Are links used for CTAs that take the user to a different location?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/question-8">Question 8:</a>** Are lists used to present groupings and enumerations?
- **<a href="/docs/core-heuristics/page-structure/question-9">Question 9:</a>** Do grouped form elements have a group label?
