title: Page Structure Question 7
description: Are links used for CTAs that take the user to a different location?
---

## Description

Ensures that links are used for calls-to-action (CTAs) that take users to new pages or different locations within the site, distinguishing them from buttons that trigger in-page actions.

## Why This Matters?

Links are intended for navigation, while buttons are used for in-page actions. Using links for navigation provides clarity for users of assistive technologies, allowing them to understand when an element will take them to a new page or location.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a site with a screen reader and encountering buttons that unexpectedly navigate to new pages, or links that perform actions within the page. Without clear distinctions, it becomes confusing to predict what will happen when you interact with these elements.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Design links to be used for navigation and ensure they are visually distinct from buttons. Avoid using links for in-page actions.

- **Developer:** Implement `<a>` elements for all navigation-related actions, ensuring that links are used for taking users to different locations, not for performing actions within the page.
