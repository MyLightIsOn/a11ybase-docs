title: Page Structure Question 9
description: Do grouped form elements have a group label?
---

## Description

Ensures that grouped form elements, such as radio buttons or checkboxes, have a clear group label (e.g., using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`), helping screen reader users understand the relationship between the grouped elements.

## Why This Matters?

For screen reader users, grouped form elements without a group label can be confusing. They rely on group labels to understand the context of each option and how they relate to each other. Without clear labels, itâ€™s harder to interpret the form's structure and meaning.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine filling out a form with several radio buttons or checkboxes, but without knowing what question or context they belong to. As a screen reader user, this would make it difficult to understand how the options relate to each other, leading to confusion.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that related form elements, such as radio buttons or checkboxes, are visually grouped with clear labels to communicate their relationships.

- **Developer:** Use semantic HTML elements such as `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to group related form elements, ensuring that screen readers can identify and announce the relationship between grouped options.
