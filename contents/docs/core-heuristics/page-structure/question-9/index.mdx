title: Page Structure Question 9
description: Use list elements when presenting information that can be grouped together logically.
---

## Description

Ensures that related information is presented using semantic list elements (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) when it can be logically grouped, helping screen readers and users easily understand the content’s structure.

## Why This Matters?

Lists help screen readers convey the relationships between grouped items clearly. Without semantic lists, related information may be read in a disjointed way, making it harder for users to follow the content and understand how items are related.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a screen reader to browse a website, but instead of hearing “list of items” or knowing how many items are in a group, you only hear each item as though it’s separate. The lack of structure makes it confusing to understand the relationships between the items.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Organize related information visually and logically, using lists where items can be grouped together to provide better clarity and structure.

- **Developer:** Use semantic HTML lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) to group related content and ensure that lists are presented accessibly to screen readers and assistive technologies.
