title: Page Structure Question 2
description: Do section headings follow a hierarchical structure and do not skip any levels?
---

## Description

Ensures that section headings are organized in a clear, hierarchical structure without skipping heading levels (e.g., moving from `<h1>` to `<h3>`), making content easier to navigate for screen readers.

## Why This Matters?

A logical heading hierarchy helps users, especially those using assistive technologies, understand the structure of the content. Skipping heading levels can confuse users about the relationships between sections, making it harder to navigate the page.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a long document using a screen reader, but the heading levels are inconsistent, skipping from a `<h2>` to a `<h4>`. Without a clear heading structure, youâ€™d struggle to follow the flow of content, making it harder to understand and navigate the page.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Plan content with a logical heading structure in mind, ensuring that headings follow a clear, hierarchical order without skipping levels.

- **Developer:** Implement heading tags (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) in a hierarchical order to maintain a consistent structure for screen readers.
