title: Page Structure Question 2
description: Use up to six heading levels in a hierarchical order, ensuring no levels are skipped to maintain a clear content structure for screen readers.
---

## Description

Ensures that heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) are used in a logical, hierarchical order without skipping levels, helping screen readers and users follow the content structure.

## Why This Matters?

Screen readers rely on the logical order of headings to navigate through content. Skipping heading levels (e.g., jumping from `<h2>` to `<h4>`) disrupts the hierarchy, confusing users and making it harder to understand the relationships between sections.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a long document using a screen reader, but the heading structure is inconsistent, with levels skipped or used out of order. This makes it difficult to understand the content's organization, leaving you unsure of how sections relate to each other.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Plan content with a logical heading structure in mind, using up to six levels of headings in a clear hierarchy.

- **Developer:** Ensure that headings are implemented in a hierarchical order, without skipping levels, to maintain a consistent content structure for screen readers.
