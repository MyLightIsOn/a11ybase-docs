## Description

Ensures that each page has a meaningful and descriptive title that provides context and helps users quickly understand the pageâ€™s purpose.

## Why This Matters?

A meaningful page title is crucial for screen readers and search engines. It helps users identify the content of the page quickly and efficiently, especially when navigating through multiple tabs or search results.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine browsing the web using a screen reader and each page has a vague or irrelevant title. Without a clear, descriptive title, you would struggle to understand what the page is about, making navigation confusing and frustrating.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that page titles are concise, clear, and provide a meaningful description of the content.

- **Developer:** Implement page titles using the `<title>` tag in the `<head>` section, ensuring they accurately reflect the content and structure of the page.
