title: Page Structure Question 1
description: Ensure that headings are semantically marked with proper heading tags, not just styled visually.
---

## Description

Ensures that headings are marked using correct HTML tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) for proper structure, rather than being styled purely for visual purposes.

## Why This Matters?

Screen readers and search engines rely on semantic heading tags to understand the structure of the content. Styling text to *look* like a heading without using proper tags disrupts the hierarchy, making navigation and comprehension difficult for users of assistive technologies.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a webpage with a screen reader, and the text visually looks like a heading, but the screen reader doesn’t recognize it as such. Without proper heading tags, you lose the clear structure that guides you through the content, making it harder to understand the page’s organization.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Design headings with clear levels in mind and ensure that headings are visually distinct while using semantic tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).

- **Developer:** Implement headings using appropriate HTML tags to maintain the correct content hierarchy. Avoid using CSS to merely style text as headings without semantic structure.
