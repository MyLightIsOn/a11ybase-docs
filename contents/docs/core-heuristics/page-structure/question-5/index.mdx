title: Page Structure Question 5
description: Is all content placed within a landmark or region?
---

## Description

Ensures that all content on a page is contained within semantic landmarks or regions (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, etc.), helping assistive technologies provide meaningful navigation.

## Why This Matters?

Landmarks and regions help screen reader users navigate through pages more efficiently by allowing them to jump to specific sections of content. Without proper landmarks, users may struggle to find the information they need or get lost within the content.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a long webpage with a screen reader but there are no landmarks. You would have to manually tab through each element to find the content youâ€™re looking for, making navigation slow and frustrating.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Plan content layout using landmarks to ensure logical sections such as header, main content, navigation, and footer are visually and functionally distinct.

- **Developer:** Implement semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`) or ARIA landmarks (`role="navigation"`, `role="main"`) to define key regions of the page.

## Examples:
