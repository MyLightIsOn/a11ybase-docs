title: Page Structure Question 5
description: Ensure consistent, predictable navigation with clear orientation tools (like breadcrumbs and site maps) to help users easily navigate the system.

## Description

Ensures that navigation across pages is consistent and predictable, and that orientation tools like breadcrumbs or site maps are provided to help users understand their location within the system.

## Why This Matters?

Consistent navigation helps all users, especially those using assistive technologies, move easily through a website. Breadcrumbs, site maps, and other orientation tools prevent users from becoming disoriented, especially when navigating complex websites.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a screen reader on a large website with multiple sections, but there are no breadcrumbs or site maps to help you understand where you are. Itâ€™s easy to get lost without these orientation tools, making it harder to navigate the site confidently.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Design clear, predictable navigation across all pages. Include orientation tools like breadcrumbs or site maps to provide additional guidance for users.

- **Developer:** Ensure that navigation components like breadcrumbs are implemented correctly and consistently across the site. Use semantic HTML and ARIA where appropriate to ensure they are accessible to all users.
