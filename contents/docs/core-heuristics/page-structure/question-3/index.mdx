title: Page Structure Question 3
description: Are navigation elements organized in a way that facilitates wayfinding?
---

## Description

Ensures that navigation elements, such as menus and links, are organized to help users easily find their way through the site, improving accessibility and usability for all users.

## Why This Matters?

Well-organized navigation helps users understand where they are on a site and how to reach other sections. For users relying on assistive technologies, poorly structured navigation can make it hard to move between pages or find important content.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a website with a screen reader, but the navigation is poorly organized. Without clear orientation tools like breadcrumbs or logical menu structures, you would feel lost, unsure of how to move between sections or find key content.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Design intuitive and consistent navigation elements that facilitate wayfinding, using tools like breadcrumbs and well-organized menus.

- **Developer:** Ensure that navigation is structured using semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.) to help screen readers and assistive technologies easily interpret and navigate through the site.
