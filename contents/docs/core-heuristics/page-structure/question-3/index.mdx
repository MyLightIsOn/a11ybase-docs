title: Page Structure Question 3
description: Ensure webpage titles are concise, place unique information first, and move redundant details like company names to the end.

## Description

Ensures webpage titles are meaningful, concise, and structured to prioritize unique information, making it easier for users and assistive technologies to understand the context of each page.

## Why This Matters?

Page titles are one of the first things screen readers and search engines interpret. Long or repetitive titles make navigation harder for users with disabilities and hinder quick identification of the content. Prioritizing unique content first helps users quickly grasp the page's purpose.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine using a screen reader to navigate multiple tabs or search results, and every title starts with the same company name, making it hard to distinguish between pages. Concise, informative titles help users identify the content without unnecessary repetition.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Work with content creators to ensure page titles are concise and present unique information before repetitive or general details like brand names.

- **Developer:** Implement page titles that follow the structure of unique content first, followed by any necessary redundant details, to enhance accessibility and usability.
