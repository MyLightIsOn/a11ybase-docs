title: Page Structure Question 4
description: Is text that looks and acts like a heading marked as a real heading?
---

## Description

Ensures that any text styled to look and function like a heading is marked with proper HTML heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), making the content accessible to screen readers.

## Why This Matters?

Screen readers rely on heading tags to identify and navigate the structure of a page. Visually styled text that isn’t marked as a heading with proper HTML tags can confuse users of assistive technologies, making it difficult for them to understand the hierarchy and organization of the content.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a webpage using a screen reader and encountering several pieces of text that look like headings but are not marked as such. You would miss important structural information, making it difficult to follow the page’s flow and content hierarchy.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that text intended to function as a heading is visually distinct and communicated as such to developers for proper HTML implementation.

- **Developer:** Use appropriate heading tags (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) for all text that acts as a heading to maintain the semantic structure and help assistive technologies navigate the page.
