title: Page Structure Question 4
description: Designate key page areas such as headers, navigation, main content, and footers as landmarks using HTML or ARIA.
---

## Description

Ensures that important sections of a webpage, such as headers, navigation, main content, and footers, are marked with semantic HTML elements or ARIA landmarks to improve navigation for screen readers.

## Why This Matters?

Landmarks help screen reader users navigate quickly to key sections of a page without tabbing through every element. Without clear landmarks, users may struggle to find the content they need, especially on complex or lengthy pages.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a long webpage using a screen reader, but there are no landmarks to guide you to the main content or the navigation. You are forced to move through each element manually, making the experience slow and frustrating.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Plan the structure of the page with clear sections in mind, ensuring that elements like headers, navigation, and footers are visually and functionally distinct.

- **Developer:** Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) or ARIA landmarks (`role="navigation"`, `role="main"`) to mark key areas of the page, making it easier for assistive technologies to recognize them.
