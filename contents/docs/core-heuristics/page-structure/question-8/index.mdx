title: Page Structure Question 8
description: Are lists used to present groupings and enumerations?
---

## Description

Ensures that lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) are used to present groupings of related items or enumerations, helping assistive technology users understand the relationships between grouped elements.

## Why This Matters?

Semantic lists provide structure and clarity for screen reader users, allowing them to understand when items are part of a group or sequence. Without proper list markup, related items may be read out of context, making it harder for users to grasp the content.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a page with a screen reader and hearing a series of items without knowing that they are part of a group or sequence. Without list elements, you would miss important relationships between the items, making it difficult to understand how theyâ€™re connected.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Organize related information visually in lists where appropriate to make groupings clearer for all users.

- **Developer:** Use semantic HTML lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) to present groupings and enumerations, ensuring they are accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies.

## Examples:
