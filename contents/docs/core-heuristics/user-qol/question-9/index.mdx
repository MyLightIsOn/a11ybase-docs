title: Are error correction suggestions provided?
description: User Quality of Life - Question 9
---

## Description

Ensures that when users make errors in forms or other inputs, clear suggestions are provided to help them correct the issue and continue successfully.

## Why This Matters?

Providing suggestions for error correction helps users, particularly those with cognitive impairments or learning disabilities, understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Without guidance, users may struggle to complete tasks or feel frustrated by unclear error messages.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine filling out a form and making a mistake, but instead of a clear explanation and suggestion for fixing the error, you only see a vague message. For users with cognitive impairments, this lack of guidance can lead to confusion and abandonment of the task.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that error messages are clear and actionable, providing users with specific suggestions on how to correct the error.

- **Developer:** Implement form validation and error messaging that includes helpful suggestions for fixing input errors, making sure these messages are communicated to assistive technologies.

## Examples:
