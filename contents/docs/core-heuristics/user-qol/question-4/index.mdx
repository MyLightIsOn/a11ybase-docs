title: Are users warned of upcoming session timeouts?
description: User Quality of Life - Question 4
---

## Description

Ensures that users are warned before a session times out, giving them the opportunity to extend the session and avoid losing unsaved data or progress.

## Why This Matters?

Session timeouts without warnings can result in lost work or interrupted tasks, which is particularly frustrating for users with disabilities who may need more time to complete tasks. Providing warnings allows users to take action before a timeout occurs, preventing unnecessary stress and loss of data.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine working on a long form or task and suddenly getting logged out without warning, losing all your progress. For users with disabilities who may work more slowly, this can be especially frustrating and discouraging.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that clear, accessible warnings are provided to users before session timeouts occur, giving them the option to extend the session or save their work.

- **Developer:** Implement session timeout warnings with functionality to extend sessions. Use accessible dialog boxes or notifications that are clearly communicated to assistive technology users.
