## Overview

**User Quality of Life** focuses on enhancing the overall user experience by ensuring that interactive elements, media, and error handling are designed to accommodate user preferences and needs. This includes creating large enough target areas for touch devices, allowing users to control media playback, and providing clear, actionable error correction suggestions. Ensuring a positive quality of life for users helps build a more inclusive and user-friendly experience.

This heuristic helps teams design for **larger target areas**, provide **controls for animated content**, and ensure that **videos have captions and transcripts**. By improving these aspects, teams can make digital products more accessible and enjoyable for all users.

## Why User Quality of Life Matters

- Enhances the user experience by making interactions more intuitive and accommodating user needs.
- Helps users with motor impairments or visual disabilities by providing larger target areas and clear, actionable feedback.
- Ensures that users have control over content, especially multimedia and animated elements, reducing sensory overload.
- Improves overall usability, creating a smoother, more satisfying user experience.

## Questions for User Quality of Life Heuristics
