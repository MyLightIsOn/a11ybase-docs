title: Are target areas large enough?
description: User Quality of Life - Question 1
---

## Description

Ensures that interactive target areas, such as buttons, links, and other clickable elements, are large enough to be easily tapped or clicked, especially on touch devices.

## Why This Matters?

Small target areas can be difficult for users with motor impairments or those using touchscreens to interact with. Larger, well-sized target areas reduce the chance of errors and frustration, improving the overall user experience.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine trying to tap a small button on your mobile phone, but your finger keeps missing it. For users with motor impairments or those with larger fingers, small target areas make the interface frustrating and difficult to navigate.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that all interactive elements have sufficiently large target areas, adhering to accessibility guidelines (at least 44x44 pixels for touch targets).

- **Developer:** Implement CSS and responsive design techniques to ensure that target areas remain large enough on all screen sizes, especially on touch devices.
