title: Does anything in the design flash more than 3 times per second?
description: User Quality of Life - Question 3
---

## Description

Ensures that no content in the design flashes more than 3 times per second, preventing the risk of seizures or other physical reactions, especially for users with photosensitive epilepsy.

## Why This Matters?

Flashing content at a rate higher than 3 times per second can trigger seizures in users with photosensitive epilepsy. Limiting flashing elements to safe thresholds reduces the risk of causing harm or discomfort to users.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine browsing a website and encountering flashing content that triggers discomfort or even a seizure. For users with photosensitive epilepsy, flashing at a high rate can cause serious harm, making the website dangerous to use.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Avoid using flashing content or, if necessary, ensure that it flashes at a rate of no more than 3 times per second to prevent triggering seizures or discomfort.

- **Developer:** Implement safeguards that prevent flashing content from exceeding the 3 times per second threshold, and ensure flashing elements can be paused or stopped.

## Examples:
