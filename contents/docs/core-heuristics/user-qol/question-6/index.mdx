title: Do pre-recorded videos have an audio description of visual content?
description: User Quality of Life - Question 6
---

## Description

Ensures that pre-recorded videos include audio descriptions of important visual content for users who are blind or visually impaired, allowing them to fully understand what is happening on-screen.

## Why This Matters?

Without audio descriptions, users who are blind or visually impaired may miss key visual information, such as actions, scenery, or non-verbal cues. Audio descriptions provide context that ensures equal access to video content for all users.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine watching a video where key moments are conveyed visually, but there’s no narration or description of what’s happening. For users who are blind or visually impaired, the lack of an audio description makes it impossible to fully engage with the video content.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that pre-recorded videos are created with accompanying audio descriptions that narrate important visual elements.

- **Developer:** Implement audio description tracks within pre-recorded videos, ensuring that they are accessible and can be turned on or off by the user.

## Examples:
