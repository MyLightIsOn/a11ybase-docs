title: Does pre-recorded audio-only and video-only content have a transcript?
description: User Quality of Life - Question 8
---

## Description

Ensures that pre-recorded audio-only (e.g., podcasts) and video-only content are accompanied by transcripts that provide a written account of the spoken or visual content, making it accessible to users who cannot access the media directly.

## Why This Matters?

Transcripts make audio and video content accessible to users who are deaf, hard of hearing, or visually impaired. They also benefit users who cannot access media due to technical constraints or who prefer reading over watching or listening.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine trying to follow an audio podcast or video without any access to the media itself. For users who are deaf or blind, a transcript provides an alternative way to access the content, ensuring they can fully engage with the material.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that all pre-recorded audio-only and video-only content is accompanied by a detailed transcript that captures all relevant information.

- **Developer:** Implement accessible methods for providing transcripts alongside audio or video content, ensuring they are easy to access and clearly associated with the media.
