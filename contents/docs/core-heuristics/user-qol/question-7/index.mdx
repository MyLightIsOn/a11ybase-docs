title: Do pre-recorded videos have captions?
description: User Quality of Life - Question 7
---

## Description

Ensures that pre-recorded videos have accurate captions to make spoken content accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as those in environments where audio cannot be played.

## Why This Matters?

Captions provide a text version of the spoken content in videos, making them accessible to users who cannot hear the audio. Captions also benefit users in noisy or quiet environments where audio is unavailable or inappropriate.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine watching a video in a public space where you can’t turn on the sound, or being deaf and unable to hear the dialogue. Without captions, you’d miss all the spoken information, leaving you unable to fully understand the video’s content.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that all pre-recorded videos are accompanied by accurate captions that reflect spoken dialogue, as well as important sound cues.

- **Developer:** Implement captioning features for pre-recorded videos, making sure captions are easy to toggle on and off and are synchronized with the audio.
