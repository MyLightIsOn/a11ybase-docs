title: Can users pause, stop, or hide animated content that continues for over 5 seconds?
description: User Quality of Life - Question 2

## Description

Ensures that users can pause, stop, or hide animated content, such as carousels or background animations, if the animation continues for more than 5 seconds, preventing distractions or discomfort.

## Why This Matters?

Continuous animations can be distracting or even harmful, particularly for users with cognitive impairments, motion sensitivity, or attention deficits. Providing controls to pause or stop animations helps users focus on the content and prevents sensory overload.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine trying to read content on a webpage while an animated carousel keeps moving in the background. For users with motion sensitivity or cognitive impairments, this can be highly distracting and make it difficult to focus on the text.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Provide visible controls for users to pause, stop, or hide animated content that persists for more than 5 seconds, ensuring the design remains accessible.

- **Developer:** Implement functionality to pause, stop, or hide animated content using accessible controls (e.g., buttons with clear labels) and ensure animations donâ€™t auto-loop without user control.

## Examples:
