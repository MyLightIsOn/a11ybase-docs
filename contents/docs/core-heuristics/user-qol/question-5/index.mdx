title: Are video and audio files set to auto-play by default?
description: User Quality of Life - Question 5
---

## Description

Ensures that video and audio files do not auto-play by default, giving users control over when and how multimedia content is played.

## Why This Matters?

Auto-playing media can be disruptive and disorienting for users, especially for those with cognitive or sensory impairments. It can also interfere with screen readers or other assistive technologies. Allowing users to choose when to play media improves their control and overall experience.

**Empathy Focus:**
> Imagine navigating a webpage and suddenly hearing a video or audio start playing without warning. For users who are sensitive to unexpected sounds or for those using screen readers, this can be distracting and overwhelming.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

- **Designer:** Ensure that video and audio content does not auto-play by default, allowing users to start media playback when they are ready.

- **Developer:** Implement media elements that require user interaction to play, and avoid using auto-play settings for video or audio content.
